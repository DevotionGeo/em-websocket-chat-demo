It is an basic app for peer to peer chat using event machine and websocket

You have to start server ruby em_chat.rb change location and port if you required
Now change in public/javascripts/em_chat.js same as modified url and port

This is developed for understanding html5 websocket and event machine.
In this there is some hack that connect if page is refresh
Process flow

After login there is one default web socket connection is establish for notifying user or maintaining session
It creates individual channel for each client


If user wants to chat it just click on user list then channel is establish betwwn them
if this user has active and channel is established
then notification is send to other user and message sends in queue
else
then notification send to sender user is not active
After acceptance of user whatever message in queue it push to all subscribe user

Here i dont know how much is reliable on production environment but you can check it out on local
and do changes as per requirement.
